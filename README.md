How to Use:
Run the program.
The default output will appear first.
You can enter commands like 1, 2,10-10-2022, etc., to get the corresponding reports.


Steps for the Program
 -> Initialization: Upon running the program, the program should display the main menu with six options and an option to quit (q or Q).
 -> User Input Handling: The user selects an option, and based on that option, the program will ask for additional input (e.g., a date for reports).
 -> Processing and Output: Based on the user's selection, the program will process the relevant data (e.g., number of employees, monthly salary report, etc.) and display the results.
 -> Sample Input File: The program will read an input file (e.g., EmployeeDetails.csv) that contains employee event data for processing.


Key Points to Note:
  -> Menu Display: The program shows the main menu first and then waits for user input.
  -> Option Selection: Based on the user's input (e.g., 1, 2, etc.), the program calls the respective method to process the data and generate the report.
  -> Date Input: For options that require date input (e.g., 2, dd-mm-yyyy), the program parses the date and processes data accordingly.
  -> Employee Data: The program loads employee data from a CSV file (EmployeeDetails.csv) and stores it in appropriate data structures.
